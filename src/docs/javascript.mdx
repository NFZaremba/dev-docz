>
> ## High Level
>
> `JavaScript` is considered _high-level_ because it does not require direct interaction with the operating system, hardware.
>
> It also does _not require memory-management_ like `C/C++` because the runtime always uses `garbage-collection`.
>
> ## Interpreted or Just-in-Time Compiled
>
> Originally, it was only _interpreted_, but modern `JavaScript engines` like V8, Spidermonkey, and Nitro use various techniques to perform _Just-in-Time Compilation (JIT)_ for better performance.
>
> ### Interpreted
>
> > Means the source code is **converted** to `bytecode` line-by-line and executed at runtime _[as opposed to being compiled to machine code binary at build time]_.
>
> ### JIT compilation
>
> > Differs from a compiler in that it compiles to native machine code just before the code is supposed to run, hence the name.
>
> ## Multi-Paradigm
>
> Means the language is general-purpose or flexible.
> `JavaScript` can be used for [declarative (functional) or imperative (object-oriented)](https://codeburst.io/declarative-vs-imperative-programming-a8a7c93d9ad2) programming styles.
>
> ### Declarative Programming
>
> > Example: is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. You don’t care how they draw it, that’s up to them.
>
> ### Imperative Programming
>
> > Example: is like your friend listening to Bob Ross tell them how to paint a landscape. While good ole Bob Ross isn’t exactly commanding, he is giving them step by step directions to get the desired result.
>
> ## Dynamic Weakly Typed
>
> `JavaScript` is _dynamic weakly typed_ language, meaning you do not explicitly annotate variables with types (`string`, `int`, etc) and the true types are _not known until runtime_.
>
> ## Prototypal Inheritance
>
> `Objects` can inherit behaviors from other `objects`.
>
> This differs from `classical inheritance` where you define a `class` or blueprint for each `object` and instantiate it.
>
> ## Event-Loop Concurrency Model
>
> ### Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O
>
> > Blocking is when the execution of additional `JavaScript` in the `Node.js` process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes. This happens because the `event loop` is unable to continue running `JavaScript` while a blocking operation is occurring.
>
> ### Single-Threaded
>
> > `JavaScript` can only run one instruction at a time, even if your CPU has multiple cores and available threads. So how does `JavaScript` handle jobs concurrently?
>
> ### Event Loop
>
> > Refers to a feature implemented by `JavaScript engines` like V8 that allow `JavaScript` to offload tasks to separate threads. Browser and Node APIs execute long-running tasks separately from the the main `JavaScript` thread, then enqueue a callback function (which you define) to run on the main thread when the task is complete. This is why `JavaScript` is called `non-blocking` because it should only ever wait for `synchronous` code from your `JavaScript` functions. Think of the `Event Loop` as message queue between the single `JavaScript` thread and the OS.

> # How JavaScript Works
>
> - [JavaScript Engine](#javaScript-engine)
> - [Runtime Environment](#runtime-environment)
>
> ## JavaScript Engine
>
> In web development, each browser has a `JavaScript Runtime Environment`, and in that runtime is a `JavaScript engine` **that parses the code**.
>
> It can be implemented as a standard `interpreter`, or `just-in-time compiler` that compiles `JavaScript` to `bytecode` in some form.
>
> There are two regions of memory that are allocated on the machine's `RAM` (Random Access Memory) when a js program is ran: it stores things like the `runtime`, `variables` and `objects` that you reference in your code in the `Heap` and `Stack`.
>
> ### Stack - _static memory allocation_
>
> > Data structure that follows the _Last In First Out (LIFO)_ principle (the last item to enter the stack will be the first item to be removed from the stack).
> >
> > Stores the `execution context` for each function, which stores `primitive` types and `references` _[these references point to objects and functions you've created]_.
> >
> > Allocating memory _during compile time_ is known as **static memory allocation**.
> >
> > - Static data have fixed sizes: `JavaScript engine` knows how much memory to allocate before execution.
> >
> > #### Execution Context
> >
> > By default, at the bottom of the ECS, we have a global execution context which deals with all the code in the global scope. Each function has its own execution context called functional execution context which gets inserted on the top of ECS as and when the function is called in the code. If the same function is called twice like in recursion, it will have two different functional execution context in the ECS.
>
> ### Heap - _dynamic memory allocation_
>
> > The `heap` is where `objects` (`objects`, `functions`, `arrays`, `classes`) are stored.
> >
> > Unlike the stack, the engine doesn't allocate a fixed amount of memory for these objects. Instead, more space will be allocated as needed.
> >
> > Allocating memory during runtime is known as _dynamic memory allocation_.
>
> ## Runtime Environment
>
> _AJAX_, the _DOM tree_, and other API’s, are not part of `JavaScript`, they are just objects with properties and methods, _provided by the browser_ and made available in the browser’s `JavaScript Runtime Environment`.
>
> It provides additional _scripts/features/API's_ at runtime to build JavaScript based software.
>
> - `Browser` - DOM API, Fetch API, Timer (setTimeout/setInterval), Storage (local storage), etc.
> - `Server Environment` - File System, Network, Console, etc
>
> Think of the `JavaScript runtime environment` as a big container. Within the big container are other smaller containers. As the `JavaScript engine` parses the code it starts putting pieces of it into different containers.
>
> ![JS Runtime Environment](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*zeKjWCjyAGZ9JN4fvnWsiA.png)
>
> ### Memory Heap
>
> > Unstructured memory pool where we can store complex objects, and is `Garbage Collected`.
>
> ### Call Stack
>
> > _LIFO principle_ - last-in-first-out.
> >
> > The call `stack` is designed to be a high performance continuous region of memory used to execute functions, and helps keep track of where we are in the code so that we can run the code in order.
> >
> > - When you call a function, it creates a frame in the stack that contains a copy of its local variables.
>
> ### Web API Container
>
> > Calls that were sent to the `Web API` container from the `Stack`, like _event listeners_, _HTTP/AJAX_ requests, or _timing_ functions, sit there until an action is triggered.
> >
> > - Once triggered, a _callback function_ is sent to the final container, the `callback queue`.
>
> ### Callback Queue
>
> > The `Queue` is a FIFO (first in first out) data structure.
> >
> > The `Callback Queue` will store all the callback functions in the order in which they were added. It will **wait** until the `Stack` is completely empty.
>
> ### Event Loop
>
> > The `Event Loop` is implemented in `runtime environment`.
> >
> > Its job is to constantly look at the `Stack` and the `Queue`. If the `Stack` is empty, it will notify the `Queue` to send over its next callback function.

> - [Memory Leaks](#memory-leaks)
>
> ## Memory Life Cycle
>
> In `JavaScript`, memory life cycle is composed of 3 steps:
>
> 1.  _Memory Allocation_ - When you assign a variable or create a function or object some amount of memory has to be allocated for it.
>
> 2.  _Memory Use_ - Reading from variables or changing values is reading from, and write to, memory.
>
> 3.  _Memory Release_ - When you no longer use some function or object, that memory is released via _Garbage Collection_.
>
> ## Memory Allocation
>
> Non-primitive data types behave differently compared to primitive data types.
>
> Remember that JavaScript stores objects and functions in the `heap`. `Primitives` and `references` are stored in the `stack`.
>
> All `variables` first point to the `stack`. In case it's a non-primitive value, the `stack` contains a `reference` to the `object` in the `heap`.
>
> | Stack                              | Heap                      |
> | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
> | Primitive values and references    | Objects and functions     |
> | Size is known at compile time      | Size is known at run time |
> | Allocates a fixed amount of memory | No limit per object       |
>
> ### Primitives
>
> > Below, we declare a variable called `myNumber` and initialize it with a value of `23`.
> >
> > ```js
> > let myNumber = 23;
> > ```
> >
> > When this code executes, `JavaScript Engine` will...
> >
> > 1.  Create a unique identifier for your variable `myNumber`.
> > 2.  Allocate an address in memory (_will be assigned at runtime_).
> > 3.  Store a value at the address allocated `23`.
> >
> > ![example 1](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*IiejRUFbks-TaOzJJvdoVw.jpeg)
> >
> > While we would colloquially say, _“myNumber equals 23”_, more technically, `myNumber` equals the memory address that holds the value `23`. This is a crucial distinction to understand.
> >
> > If we were to create a new variable called `newVar` and assign it `myNumber` …
> >
> > ```js
> > let newVar = myNumber;
> > ```
> >
> > ... since `myNumber` technically equals _“0012CCGWH80”_, `newVar` would also equal _“0012CCGWH80”_, which is the memory address that holds the value `23`. Ultimately, this has the intended effect of colloquially saying, _“newVar is now equal to 23.”_ ![example 2](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*AaUqtuwa2BZiI73bV9RHmA.jpeg)
> >
> > Take a look at another example...
> >
> > ```js
> > let myString = "abc";
> > myString = myString + "d";
> > ```
> >
> > ... while a novice JS programmer may say that the letter `d` is simply appended to the string `abc` wherever it exists in memory, this is technically false. When `abc` is concatenated with `d`, since `strings` are also `primitive data types` in JS, a new memory address is allocated, `abcd` is stored there, and `myString` points to this new memory address.
> >
> > ![example 3](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*WQHSspJDrPGOQ9L8R01jmw.jpeg)
> >
> > Another example:
> >
> > ```js
> > let name = "John"; // allocates memory for a string
> > const age = 24; // allocates memory for a number
> >
> > name = "John Doe"; // allocates memory for a new string
> > const firstName = name.slice(0, 4); // allocates memory for a new string
> >
> > // -> Primitive values are immutable, which means that instead of changing the original value, JavaScript creates a new one.
> > ```
>
> ### References
>
> > The memory of the `heap` is not ordered in any particular way, which is why we need to keep a `reference` to it in the stack.
> >
> > _You can think of `references` as addresses and the objects in the `heap` as houses that these addresses belong to_.
> >
> > Let's start with an example...
> >
> > ```js
> > let myArray = [];
> > ```
> >
> > This is what happens in memory:
> >
> > 1.  Create a unique identifier for your variable `myArray`.
> > 2.  Allocate an address in memory (_will be assigned at runtime_).
> > 3.  Store a value of a memory address allocated on the heap (_will be assigned at runtime_).
> > 4.  The memory address on the heap stores the value assigned (_the empty `array []`_).
> >
> > ![example 4](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*CPnnVIgE0tQVbxIja_C-_A.jpeg)
> >
> > ![example 5](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*0x_h4Q0eu-rpA0YxHJBJdg.jpeg)
> >
> > From here, we could `push`, `pop`, or do whatever we wanted to to our `array`.
> >
> > ```js
> > myArray.push("first");
> > myArray.push("second");
> > myArray.push("third");
> > myArray.push("fourth");
> > myArray.pop();
> > ```
> >
> > ![example 6](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*XfqW2Xh5oJrChzhRAauf9Q.jpeg)
> >
> > More Examples:
> >
> > ```js
> > const person = {
> >   name: "John",
> >   age: 24,
> > };
> >
> > // -> JS allocates memory for this object in the heap.
> > // -> The actual values are still primitive, which is why they are stored in the stack.
> > ```

> >
> > Note above how `person` and `newPerson` both point to the same object.
>
> ## Garbage Collection
>
> The last step is releasing memory and this is where `garbage collection` comes into play (which is also handled by the `JavaScript Engine`).
>
> _Algorithms_ are used to pinpoint unneeded memory that needs to be released. The _mark-and-sweep algorithm_ has been implemented in all modern browsers since 2012.
>
> ### Mark-and-sweep algorithm
>
> > The mark-and-sweep algorithm has a solution to cyclic dependencies. Instead of simply counting the `references` to a given `object`, it detects if they are _reachable from the root object_.
> >
> > - The `root` in the browser is the `window` object, while in NodeJS this is `global`.
> >
> > The algorithm _marks the `objects` that aren't reachable_ as garbage, and _sweeps (collects) them afterward_. `Root objects` will never be collected.
> >
> > ![mark-and-sweep algorithm](https://felixgerschau.com/static/87b4e1eb66afc84d49da13af8e897367/c1b63/garbage-collectoion-algorithm.png)
>
> ### Trade-offs
>
> > Automatic `garbage collection` allows us to focus on building applications instead of losing time with memory management. However, there are some tradeoffs that we need to be aware of.
> >
> > #### Memory usage
> >
> > - Given that the algorithms can't know when exactly memory won't be needed anymore, _JavaScript applications may use more memory than they actually need_.
> > - Even though `objects` are marked as garbage, it's up to the `garbage collector` to decide when and if the allocated memory will be collected.
> > - If you need your application to be as memory efficient as possible, you're better off with a lower-level language. But keep in mind that this comes with its own set of trade-offs.
> >
> > #### Performance
> >
> > - The algorithms that collect garbage for us usually run periodically to clean unused `objects`.
> > - The issue with this is that we, the developers, don't know when exactly this will happen. Collecting a lot of garbage or collecting garbage frequently might impact performance since it needs a certain amount of computation power to do so.
>
> ## Memory Leaks
>
> Here are the most common memory leaks:
>
> ### Global variables
>
> > - Storing data in `global variables` is probably the most common type of memory leak.
> > - Avoid this by running your code in _strict mode_.
> > - You can certainly make use of `global variables`, but make sure you free space up once you don't need the data anymore.
> > - To release memory, assign the `global variable` to `null`.
> >   - _Note_: ES6 modules are JavaScript files that executes in _strict mode only_. It means that any variables or functions declared in the module won’t be added automatically to the global scope.
>
> ### Forgotten timers and callbacks
>
> > - Forgetting about `timers` and `callbacks` can make the memory usage of your application go up. Especially in Single Page Applications (`SPAs`), you have to be careful when adding `event listeners` and `callbacks` dynamically.
> > - _Make sure to clear and remove any `listeners` or `timers`_.

>
> - [Primitives](#primitives)
> - [Objects](#objects)
>
> ## Primitives
>
> `Primitive` types are _immutable_, they can be reassigned to a `variable` but not changed directly (_a new memory address will be allocated if reassigned_).
>
> There are 7 types in `JavaScript`, 6 `primitives` and the `object`.
>
> - `string`
> - `number`
> - `boolean`
> - `null`
> - `undefined`
> - `symbol` (the latest addition)
>
> ### null
>
> > `null` is a `primitive` type and an assignment value, can be thought of as an intentional absence of a value since it must be assigned.
> >
> > `null` should be set explicitly, so that any `null` values that is encountered will tell you that it is intentional.
>
> ### undefined
>
> > `undefined` is a primitive type that is returned if a variable was declared but not assigned a value.
> >
> > `undefined` should only be set by the `JavaScript Engine` implicitly when it executes code because it lets you know that this undefined value is unintentional (_unless pointing to a declared variable that has been hoisted in which case it is your fault_).
> >
> > ![null vs undefined](https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9M2J.png)
> >
> > `undefined` can also occur:
> >
> > ```js
> > // if an object's property doesn't exist...
> > let myDetails = {
> >   age: 27,
> > };
> > console.log(myDetails.name); // -> undefined
> >
> > // or a function has a missing parameter...
> > function getName(name) {
> >   return name;
> > }
> > getString(); // undefined
> >
> > // and default parameters will only work if the parameter is `undefined`
> > function getFullName(firstName = "ricky", lastName = "bobby") {
> >   `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // -> 'hi'
> > }
> > getFullName();
> > ```
>
> ## Objects
>
> `Objects` represent more complex data types.
>
> - `Arrays`
> - `Functions`
> - `Classes`
>
> Anything that is not a Primitive type will inherit from an `Object`.

> - [Operators](#operators)
> - [Loops](#loops)
>
> ## Coercion
>
> Type `Coercion` is the conversion of a value from _one type to another_. It can occur:
>
> - _Explicit_ - when you intentionally want to convert the type.
> - _Implicit_ - when the `JavaScript engine` does it for you.
>
> When using an `if` statement or other statements that expect a `Boolean` value (such as the `!` NOT) and the expression given is not a `Boolean` value, `JavaScript` will implicitly coerce and transform the expression into a `Boolean` value.
>
> ```js
> // truthy
> true
> 1
> ' '
> []
> {}
> function(){}
>
> // falsey
> false
> 0
> undefined
> null
> ''
> ```
>
> ### Explicit Coercion
>
> > _Explicit Coercion_ is when you type cast a value from one type to another through the use of functions (`wrapper objects`) like `Number()` and `String()`.
> >
> > ```js
> > String(42); // ->  "42"
> > String(undefined); // -> "undefined"
> >
> > Number("12"); // -> 12
> > Number("abc"); // -> NaN
> > Number(undefined); // -> NaN
> >
> > Boolean(0); // -> false
> > Boolean(1); // -> true
> > Boolean(10); // -> true
> > ```
>
> ### Implicit Coercion
>
> > _Implicit Coercion_ is when `JavaScript` handles the type conversion for you behind the scenes (_using the same functions above_). It will mostly take place in an expression with operands of different types.
>
> ### Object Wrapper
>
> > `JavaScript` promptly coerces between `primitives` and `objects`.
> >
> > ```js
> > var str = "hello";
> > console.log(str.toUpperCase()); // -> HELLO
> > ```
> >
> > _Question_: If `strings` are `primitive` types, how do they have properties?
> >
> > - _Answer_: whenever you try to access a property of a `string` str, `JavaScript` coerces the `string` value to an `object`, by `new String(str)`. This `object` is called a `wrapper object`. _It inherits all string methods_, and is used to resolve the property reference. Once the property has been resolved, the `wrapper object` is discarded. <br /> (**Note**: the same concept applies to `numbers` and `booleans`)
> >
> > So the above code translates to this via the `JavaScript engine`...
> >
> > ```js
> > new String(str).toUpperCase();
> > ```
> >
> > This is essentially the reason why the following piece of code yields an `undefined`:
> >
> > ```js
> > var str = "hello";
> > str.custom = 1;
> > console.log(str.custom); // -> undefined
> >
> > -------------------------------------------------------------
> >
> > // which translates to
> > var str = "hello";
> > var temp = new String(str); // wrapper object
> > temp.custom = 1;
> > // end of the line for temp
> >
> > console.log(str.custom); // creates new temp wrapper object
> > // custom property does not exist on this object, thus it is 'undefined'
> > ```
>
> ## Operators
>
> In `JavaScript` you have the following main operators:
>
> - _assignment operators_
> - _comparison operators_
> - _arithmetic operators_
> - _logical operators_
>
> ### Assignment Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.
>
> > Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
> >
> > ```js
> > let x = 10; // -> The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
> > x += 5; // -> x = 15
> > x -= 5; // -> x = 5
> > x *= 5; // -> x = 50
> > ```
>
> ### Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.
>
> > Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic between variables and/or values.
> >
> > ```js
> > 10 + 10; // -> 20
> > 10 - 10; // -> 0
> > "10" - 10; // -> 0
> > 10 - "10"; // -> 0
> > "10" + 10; // -> '1010'
> > 10 + "10"; // -> '1010'
> > null + ""; // -> 'null'
> > null + undefined; // NaN
> > ```
> >
> > #### String conversion
> >
> > If we have two numbers, `JavaScript` will output the sum of those numbers. But if only one of the values is a number, `JavaScript` _will convert both values to strings and concatenate those values_.
> >
> > - `JavaScript Engine` will use `String()` method to convert types to a `string`.
> >
> > ```js
> > "2" + 2 // -> "22" - translates to: "2" + new String(2)
> > "hi" + 2 // -> "hi2"
> > [] + 2 // -> "2"
> > [2] + 2 // -> "22" - engine converts both to strings
> >
> > 15 + 3 + "2" // -> "182" - adds first two operands 18 + '2'
> > "2" + 15 + 3 // -> "2153" - engine evaluates first operand as string and adds the rest
> > ```
> >
> > #### Number conversion
> >
> > - `JavaScript Engine` will use `Number()` method to convert types to a `number`.
> >
> > ```js
> > "2" - 2; // -> 0 - translates to: new Number("2") - 2
> > "2" * 2; // -> 4
> > "2" / 2; // -> 1
> >
> > "hi" - 2; // -> NaN - "hi" can't be converted to a string so we get NaN
> > "hi" * 2; // -> NaN
> > "hi" / 2; // -> NaN
> >
> > [] - 2 // -> -2 - the object will be converted to 0.
> > [] * 2 // -> 0
> > [] / 2 // -> 0
> > ```
> >
> > #### Boolean conversion
> >
> > Any `true` will be converted to _1_ and any `false` to _0_.
> >
> > - `JavaScript Engine` will use `Boolean()` method to convert types to a `boolean`.
> >
> > ```js
> > true + true; // -> 2
> > 1 + false; // -> 1
> > !!"Hi there"; // -> true
> > !!2; // -> true
> >
> > // All values in `JavaScript` can be converted to `true` except for the following:
> > !!"";
> > !!0;
> > !!undefined;
> > !!null;
> > !!NaN;
> > !!false;
> > ```
> >
> > _Hint_: Use double bang to convert any value into a boolean.
>
> ### Comparison Operators: `==`, `===`, `!=`, etc.
>
> > We use these operators to evaluate two expressions. As the computer runs the code, the operator will return either a `true` (if the statement evaluates to `true`) or a `false` (if the statement evaluates to not `true`).
> >
> > ```js
> > 1 > 2; // -> false
> > 2 < 3; // -> true
> > 10 >=; // -> true
> > 100 <= 1; // -> false
> >
> > 2 == "2"; // -> true - with type coercion
> > 2 === "2"; // -> false - without type coercion
> > ```
>
> ### Logical Operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`, etc.
>
> > Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
> >
> > #### Logical AND: `&&`
> >
> > - The _first_ expression will immediatley return (**short-circuit**) if it evaluates to `falsey`, otherwise returns the _second_ expression if _first_ expression is `truthy`.
> >
> > ```js
> > 3 > 0 && -2 > 0; // ->  false
> >
> > true && true; // -> true
> > true && false; // -> false

> ## Scope
>
> _Scope_ in `JavaScript` refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of `variables`.
>
> `JavaScript` has two scopes: _global_ and _local_. Local scope has two variations: the old function scope, and the new block scope introduced with ES6.

> ### Global Scope
>
> > In a script, the outermost scope is the **global scope**.
> >
> > - The use of global variables is discouraged in `JavaScript`. This is, for example, because they can potentially be overwritten by other scripts, or from elsewhere in your program.

This is because instead of creating a new _local variable_ with `var`, you are reassigning the same variable in the same scope. _`var` does not recognize if to be part of a different, new scope_.
