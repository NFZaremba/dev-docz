# Data Types

## Primitives

`Primitive` types are _immutable_, they can be reassigned to a `variable` but not changed directly (_a new memory address will be allocated if reassigned_).

There are 7 types in `JavaScript`, 6 `primitives` and the `object`.

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol` (the latest addition)

> ### **null**
>
> `null` is a `primitive` type and an assignment value, can be thought of as an intentional absence of a value since it must be assigned.
>
> `null` should be set explicitly, so that any `null` values that is encountered will tell you that it is intentional.

> ### **undefined**
>
> `undefined` is a primitive type that is returned if a variable was declared but not assigned a value.
>
> `undefined` should only be set by the `JavaScript Engine` implicitly when it executes code because it lets you know that this undefined value is unintentional (_unless pointing to a declared variable that has been hoisted in which case it is your fault_).

> `undefined` can also occur:
>
> ```js
> // if an object's property doesn't exist...
> let myDetails = {
>   age: 27,
> };
> console.log(myDetails.name); // -> undefined
>
> // or a function has a missing parameter...
> function getName(name) {
>   return name;
> }
> getString(); // undefined
>
> // and default parameters will only work if the parameter is `undefined`
> function getFullName(firstName = "ricky", lastName = "bobby") {
>   `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // -> 'hi'
> }
> getFullName();
> ```

## Objects

`Objects` represent more complex data types.

- `Arrays`
- `Functions`
- `Classes`

Anything that is not a Primitive type will inherit from an `Object`.
