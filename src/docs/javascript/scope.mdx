## Scope

Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of variables to JavaScript

### var, let, and const

`JavaScript` has three different keywords to declare a variable, which adds an extra layer of intricacy to the language.

The differences between the three are based on `scope`, `hoisting`, and `reassignment`.

| Stack   | Heap           | Hoisting | Can Be Reassigned | Can Be Redeclared |
| ------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `var`   | Function scope | Yes      | Yes               | Yes               |
| `let`   | Block scope    | No       | Yes               | No                |
| `const` | Block scope    | No       | No                | No                |

> A commonly accepted practice is to use `const` as much as possible, and `let` in the case of loops and reassignment.

### Variable Scope

The two types of scope are local and global:

- `Global` variables are those declared outside of a block
- `Local` variables are those declared inside of a block
