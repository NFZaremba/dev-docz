# How JavaScript Works

<br />

## JavaScript Engine vs Runtime Environment

In web development, each browser has a `JavaScript Runtime Environment`, and in that runtime is a `JavaScript engine` that parses the code.

_AJAX_, the _DOM tree_, and other _API’s_, are not part of `JavaScript`, they are just objects with properties and methods, provided by the browser and made available in the browser’s `JS Runtime Environment`.

> ### **JavaScript Engine**
>
> Is a program or an _interpreter_ which _parses and executes JavaScript code_.
>
> It can be implemented as a standard `interpreter`, or `just-in-time compiler` that compiles `JavaScript` to `bytecode` in some form.
>
> When running a `JavaScript` program, two regions of memory are allocated on the machine's `RAM` (Random Access Memory), to store things like the `runtime`, `variables` and `objects` that you reference in your code. The `Heap` and `Stack`.

> ### **Runtime Environment**
>
> Provides additional _scripts/features/API's_ at runtime to build JavaScript based software.
>
> - `Browser` - DOM API, Fetch API, Timer (setTimeout/setInterval), Storage (local storage), etc.
> - `Server Environment` - File System, Network, Console, etc
>
> Think of the `JavaScript runtime environment` as a big container. Within the big container are other smaller containers. As the `JavaScript engine` parses the code it starts putting pieces of it into different containers.

>
> > #### **Memory Heap**
> >
> > - Unstructured memory pool where we can store complex objects.
> > - Is `Garbage Collected`.
>
> > #### **Call Stack**
> >
> > - LIFO principle - last-in-first-out.
> > - Helps keep track of where we are in the code so that we can run the code in order.
> > - The call stack is designed to be a high performance continuous region of memory used to execute functions.
> > - When you call a function, it creates a frame in the stack that contains a copy of its local variables.
>
> > #### **Web API Container**
> >
> > - Calls that were sent to the `Web API` container from the `Stack`, like event listeners, HTTP/AJAX requests, or timing functions, sit there until an action is triggered.
> > - Once triggered, a 'callback function' is sent to the final container, the `callback queue`.
>
> > #### **Callback Queue**
> >
> > - The `Queue` is a FIFO (first in first out) data structure.
> > - The `Callback Queue` will store all the callback functions in the order in which they were added. It will 'wait' until the `Stack` is completely empty.
>
> > #### **Event Loop**
> >
> > - The `Event Loop` is implemented in runtime environment.
> > - Its job is to constantly look at the `Stack` and the `Queue`. If the `Stack` is empty, it will notify the `Queue` to send over its next callback function.

## Execution Context

How does the javascript code get executed?
