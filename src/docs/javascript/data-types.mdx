# Data Types

<br />

## Primitives

---

`JavaScript` is a dynamic language, meaning that you **don't** have to define the type of your `variables` when you define them.

There are 7 types in `JavaScript`, 6 `primitives` and the `object`.

`Primitive` types are **immutable**, they can be reassigned to a variable but not changed directly (**a new memory address will be allocated**).

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol` (the latest addition)

<br />

## Objects

---

Objects represent more complex data types.

- `Arrays`
- `Functions`
- `Classes`

Anything that is not a Primitive type will inherit from an Object.

<br />

## Null vs Undefined

### null

- `null` is a `primitive` type and an assignment value, can be thought of as an intentional absence of a value since it must be assigned.
- `null` should be set explicitly, so that any `null` values that is encountered will tell you that it is intentional.

### undefined

- `undefined` is a primitive type that is returned if a variable was declared but not assigned a value.
- `undefined` should only be set by the `JavaScript Engine` implicitly when it executes code because it lets you know that this undefined value is unintentional (**unless pointing to a declared variable that has been hoisted in which case it is your fault**).

<br />

`undefined` can also occur if an object's proprty doesn't exist...

```js
let myDetails = {
  age: 27,
};

console.log(myDetails.name); // -> undefined
```

or a function has a missing parameter...

```js
function getString(str) {
  console.log(str); // -> undefined
}

getString();
```

and default parameters will only work if the parameter is `undefined`.

```js
function getString(str = "hi") {
  console.log(str); // -> 'hi'
}
getString();

function getStrings(str = "hi") {
  console.log(str); // -> null
}
getStrings(null);
```
