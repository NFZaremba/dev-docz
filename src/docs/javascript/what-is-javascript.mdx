# What is JavaScript?

<br />

## High Level

`JavaScript` is considered _high-level_ because it does not require direct interaction with the operating system, hardware.

In addition, it does _not require memory-management_ like `C/C++` because the runtime always uses `garbage-collection`.

<br />

## Interpreted or Just-in-Time Compiled

Originally, it was only _interpreted_, but modern `JavaScript engines` like V8, Spidermonkey, and Nitro use various techniques to perform _Just-in-Time Compilation (JIT)_ for better performance.

> ### **Interpreted**
>
> - means the source code is _converted_ to `bytecode` line-by-line and executed at runtime (_as opposed to being compiled to a machine code binary at build time_).

> ### **JIT compilation**
>
> - differs from a compiler in that it compiles to native machine code just before the code is supposed to run, hence the name.

<br />

## Multi-Paradigm

Means the language is general-purpose or flexible.

`JavaScript` can be used for [declarative **(functional)** **or** imperative **(object-oriented)**](https://codeburst.io/declarative-vs-imperative-programming-a8a7c93d9ad2) programming styles.

> ### **Declarative Programming**
>
> - is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. You don’t care how they draw it, that’s up to them.

> ### **Imperative Programming**
>
> - is like your friend listening to Bob Ross tell them how to paint a landscape. While good ole Bob Ross isn’t exactly commanding, he is giving them step by step directions to get the desired result.

<br />

## Dynamic Weakly Typed

`JavaScript` is _dynamic weakly typed_ language, meaning you do not explicitly annotate variables with types (`string`, `int`, etc) and the true types are _not known until runtime_.

<br />

## Prototypal Inheritance

`Objects` can inherit behaviors from other `objects`.

This differs from `classical inheritance` where you define a `class` or blueprint for each `object` and instantiate it.

<br />

## Event-Loop Concurrency Model

> ### **Single-Threaded**
>
> - means that `JavaScript` can only run one instruction at a time, even if your CPU has multiple cores and available threads. So how does `JavaScript` handle jobs concurrently?

> ### **Event Loop**
>
> - refers to a feature implemented by `JavaScript engines` like V8 that allow `JavaScript` to offload tasks to separate threads. Browser and Node APIs execute long-running tasks separately from the the main `JavaScript` thread, then enqueue a callback function (which you define) to run on the main thread when the task is complete. This is why `JavaScript` is called `non-blocking` because it should only ever wait for `synchronous` code from your `JavaScript` functions. Think of the `Event Loop` as message queue between the single `JavaScript` thread and the OS.
