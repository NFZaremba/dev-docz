# Advanced: Scope, Hoisting, & Closures

<br />

## Scope

_Scope_ in `JavaScript` refers to the current context of code, which determines the accessibility of `variables`.

`JavaScript` has two scopes: _global_ and _local_. Local scope has two variations: the old function scope, and the new block scope introduced with ES6.

- **Global**: variables declared _outside_ of a block
- **Local**: variables declared _inside_ of a block
  - function scope
  - block scope

> ### **Global Scope**
>
> In a script, the outermost scope is the **global scope**.
>
> - The use of global variables is discouraged in `JavaScript`. This is, for example, because they can potentially be overwritten by other scripts, or from elsewhere in your program.
>
> ```js
> // Global Scope
>
> const name = "Monique";
>
> function sayHi() {
>   console.log(`Hi ${name}`);
> }
>
> sayHi(); // -> Hi Monique
> ```

> ### **Local Scope**
>
> There are three ways to declare a variable in JavaScript: by using `var`, `let` and `const` keywords.
>
> - Differences: based on _scope_, _hoisting_, and _reassignment_.
> - Best practice: use `const` as much as possible, and `let` in the case of loops and reassignment.

> | Stack   | Heap           | Hoisting | Can Be Reassigned | Can Be Redeclared |
> | ------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
> | `var`   | Function scope | Yes      | Yes               | Yes               |
> | `let`   | Block scope    | No       | Yes               | No                |
> | `const` | Block scope    | No       | No                | No                |
>
> > #### **function scope**: `var`, `let` `const`
> >
> > Defines a scope for variables declared using `var`, `let` and `const`. _Any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions_.
> >
> > ```js
> > // Initialize a global variable
> > var species = "human";
> >
> > function transform() {
> >   // Initialize a local, function-scoped variable
> >   var species = "werewolf";
> >   console.log(species);
> > }
> >
> > console.log(species); // -> "human"
> > transform(); // -> "werewolf"
> > console.log(species); // -> "human"
> > ```
> >
> > Variables declared with the `var` keyword are always function-scoped, meaning they **recognize functions as having a separate scope**.This locally-scoped variable is therefore not accessible from the global scope.
>
> > #### **block scope**: `let`, `const`
> >
> > On the otherhand (any block of curly braces like `if`, `for`, etc.) defines a scope only for variables declared with the `let` and `const` keywords. _not `var` becuase it is limited to function scope_, meaning that new scope can only be created inside functions.

> > let species = "human";
> >
> > if (true) {
> > let species = "werewolf";
> > console.log(species); // -> "werewolf"

> >

> > ```
> >
> > `let` and `const`, are _block-scoped_. This means that a new, local scope is created from any kind of block, including`function blocks`,`if`statements, and`for`and`while` loops.
> >
> > However in the bottom example, both the global variable and the block-scoped variable end up with the same value, 'werewolf'. This is because instead of creating a new _local variable_ with `var`, you are reassigning the same variable in the same scope. _`var` does not recognize if to be part of a different, new scope_.

## Hoisting

During compile phase, just microseconds before code execution, it is scanned for _declarations_ (`functions` & `variables`).

All these declarations are added to the memory inside a `JavaScript` data structure called `Lexical Environment`. _So that they can be used even before they are actually declared in the source code_.

> ### **Lexical Environment**
>
> Is a data structure that holds **identifier-variable mapping**, and a place where variables and functions live during the program execution
>
> - _identifier_: refers to the **name** of variables/functions
> - _variable_: refers to `object` **references** and `primitive` **values**.
>
> This is what a lexical environment conceptually look like:
>
> ```js
> LexicalEnvironment = {
>  Identifier:  <value>,
>  Identifier:  <function object>
> }
> ```

> ### **Hoisting**
>
> Only declarations (`function`, `var`, `let`, `const` and `class`) are hoisted in `JavaScript` _not their assignments_ (`value`).
>
> - `var` declarations are initialized with `undefined`
> - `let` and `const` declarations _remain uninitialized_.
>
> > #### **Function Expressions**: _not hoisted_
> >
> > Only function declarations are hoisted in `JavaScript`, function expressions are not hoisted.
> >
> > ```js
> > helloWorld(); // -> TypeError: helloWorld is not a function
> >
> > var helloWorld = function() {
> >   console.log("Hello World!");
> > };
> > ```
> >
> > `JavaScript` only hoist declarations, not initializations (assignments), so the `helloWorld` will be _treated as a variable_, not as a function. Because `helloWorld` is a variable, the engine will assign it with `undefined` during hoisting.
>
> > #### **Function Declarations**: _hoisted_
> >
> > Function declarations are added to the memory during the compile stage, so we are able to access it in our code before the actual function declaration.
> >
> > ```js
> > helloWorld(); // -> 'Hello World!'
> >
> > function helloWorld() {
> >   console.log("Hello World!");
> > }
> >
> > --------------------------------
> >
> > // Lexical Environment
> > lexicalEnvironment = {
> >  helloWorld: < func >
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > So when the `JavaScript engine` encounters a call to **helloWorld()**, it will look into the `lexical environment`, finds the function and will be able to execute it.
>
> > #### **var**: _hoisted_
> >
> > Why do we get `undefined` below?
> >
> > ```js
> > console.log(a); // -> 'undefined'
> > var a = 3;
> > ```
> >
> > When `JavaScript engine` finds a `var` variable declaration during the compile phase, it will add that variable to the `lexical environment` and initialize it with `undefined` and later during the execution when it reaches the line where the actual assignment is done in the code, it will assign that value to the variable.
>
> > #### **let / const**: _hoisted_
> >
> > So are `let` and `const` variables not hoisted?
> >
> > ```js
> > console.log(a); // -> ReferenceError: a is not defined
> > let a = 3;
> > ```
> >
> > Remeber declarations (`function`, `var`, `let`, `const` and `class`) are hoisted in `JavaScript`.
> >
> > While `var` declarations are initialized with `undefined`. `let` and `const` declarations _remain uninitialized_.
> >
> > They will only get initialized when their _lexical binding (assignment)_ is evaluated during runtime by the `JavaScript engine`.
> >
> > This means you can’t access the variable before the engine evaluates its value at the place it was declared in the source code.
> >
> > This is what we call _“Temporal Dead Zone”_...
> >
> > ```js
> > {
> >   // Temporal dead one (TDZ) starts at the beginning of the scope
> >   console.log(state); // output: "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'state' before initialization
> >   let state = "ready"; // end of TDZ. TDZ ends at actual variable declaration
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > ...a time span between variable creation and its initialization where they can’t be accessed.
> >
> > This is a mechanism that ensures better coding practice, forcing you to declare a variable before you use it.
> >
> > **Another example:**
> >
> > ```js
> > let a;
> > console.log(a); // outputs undefined
> > a = 5;
> > ```
> >
> > Here during the compile phase, the `JavaScript engine` encounters the variable `a` and stores it in the `lexical environment`, but because it’s a `let` variable, the engine does not initialize it with any value.
> >
> > Now if we try to access the variable before it is declared, the `JavaScript engine` will try to fetch the value of the variable from the `lexical environment`, because the variable is _uninitialized_, it will throw a reference error.
> >
> > During the execution, when the engine reaches the line where the variable was declared, it will try to evaluate its _binding (value)_, because the variable has no value associated with it, it will assign it `undefined`.
>
> > #### **Class Declarations**: _hoisted_
> >
> > Just like `let` and `const` declarations, `classes` in `JavaScript` are also hoisted and _remain uninitialized_ until evaluation. So they are also affected by the _“Temporal Dead Zone”_...
> >
> > ```js
> > let peter = new Person("Peter", 25); // -> ReferenceError: Person is not defined
> >
> > console.log(peter);
> >
> > class Person {
> >   constructor(name, age) {
> >     this.name = name;
> >     this.age = age;
> >   }
> > }
> > ```
> >
> > So to access the classes, you have to declare them first...
> >
> > ```js
> > class Person {
> >   constructor(name, age) {
> >     this.name = name;
> >     this.age = age;
> >   }
> > }
> > let peter = new Person("Peter", 25);
> > console.log(peter); // -> Person { name: 'Peter', age: 25 }
> > ```
>
> > #### **Class Expressions**: _not hoisted_
> >
> > Just like function expressions, class expressions are also not hoisted.
> >
> > This will not work...
> >
> > ```js
> > let peter = new Person("Peter", 25); // -> ReferenceError: Person is not defined
> >
> > console.log(peter);
> >
> > let Person = class {
> >   constructor(name, age) {
> >     this.name = name;
> >     this.age = age;
> >   }
> > };
> > ```
> >
> > ...correct way is to declare them before evaluation.
> >
> > ```js
> > let Person = class {
> >   constructor(name, age) {
> >     this.name = name;
> >     this.age = age;
> >   }
> > };
> >
> > let peter = new Person("Peter", 25);
> > console.log(peter); // -> Person { name: 'Peter', age: 25 }
> > ```
