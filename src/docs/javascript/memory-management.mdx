# Memory Management

<br />

## Memory Life Cycle

---

In `JavaScript`, memory life cycle is composed of 3 steps:

1. **Memory Allocation** - When you assign a variable or create a function or object some amount of memory has to be allocated for it.
2. **Memory Use** - Reading from variables or changing values is reading from, and write to, memory.
3. **Memory Release** - When you no longer use some function or object, that memory is released via **Garbage Collection**.

But where is the memory allocation happening?...

<br />
<br />

## Memory Heap and Call Stack

---

`JavaScript engines` have two places where they can store data: The **memory heap** and **stack** located in the `RAM`.

### Stack - `static memory allocation`

- The `stack` is where static data is stored, including `primitive` data types and `references` (**these references point to objects and functions you've created**)
- The static data have fixed sizes and so the `JavaScript engine` knows how much memory to allocate before execution.
- Allocating memory during compile time is known as **static memory allocation**.

### Heap - `dynamic memory allocation`

- The `heap` is where `objects` (`objects`, `functions`, `arrays`, `classes`) are stored.
- Unlike the stack, the engine doesn't allocate a fixed amount of memory for these objects. Instead, more space will be allocated as needed.
- Allocating memory during runtime is known as **dynamic memory allocation**.

| Stack                              | Heap                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Primitive values and references    | Objects and functions     |
| Size is known at compile time      | Size is known at run time |
| Allocates a fixed amount of memory | No limit per object       |

## Memory Allocation for Primitives

---

Let’s start off with a simple example. Below, we declare a variable called `myNumber` and initialize it with a value of `23`.

```js
let myNumber = 23;
```

When this code executes, `JavaScript Engine` will...

1. Create a unique identifier for your variable `myNumber`.
2. Allocate an address in memory (**will be assigned at runtime**).
3. Store a value at the address allocated `23`.

![example 1](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*IiejRUFbks-TaOzJJvdoVw.jpeg)

While we would colloquially say, **“myNumber equals 23”**, more technically, `myNumber` equals the memory address that holds the value `23`. This is a crucial distinction to understand.

If we were to create a new variable called `newVar` and assign it `myNumber…`

```js
let newVar = myNumber;
```

… since `myNumber` technically equals **“0012CCGWH80”**, `newVar` would also equal **“0012CCGWH80”**, which is the memory address that holds the value `23`. Ultimately, this has the intended effect of colloquially saying, **“newVar is now equal to 23.”**

![example 2](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*AaUqtuwa2BZiI73bV9RHmA.jpeg)

#### Here’s another example:

```js
let myString = "abc";
myString = myString + "d";
```

While a novice JS programmer may say that the letter `d` is simply appended to the string `abc` wherever it exists in memory, this is technically false. When `abc` is concatenated with `d`, since `strings` are also `primitive data types` in JS, a new memory address is allocated, `abcd` is stored there, and `myString` points to this new memory address.

![example 3](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*WQHSspJDrPGOQ9L8R01jmw.jpeg)

#### More Examples

```js
let name = "John"; // allocates memory for a string
const age = 24; // allocates memory for a number

name = "John Doe"; // allocates memory for a new string
const firstName = name.slice(0, 4); // allocates memory for a new string

// -> Primitive values are immutable, which means that instead of changing the original value, JavaScript creates a new one.
```

<br />

## Memory Allocation for References

---

All `variables` first point to the `stack`. In case it's a non-primitive value, the `stack` contains a `reference` to the `object` in the `heap`.

The memory of the `heap` is not ordered in any particular way, which is why we need to keep a `reference` to it in the stack. **You can think of references as addresses and the objects in the `heap` as houses that these addresses belong to**.

> Remember that JavaScript stores objects and functions in the `heap`. `Primitive values` and `references` are stored in the `stack`.

Let's start with an example...

```js
let myArray = [];
```

This is what happens in memory:

1. Create a unique identifier for your variable `myArray`.
2. Allocate an address in memory (**will be assigned at runtime**).
3. Store a value of a memory address allocated on the heap (**will be assigned at runtime**).
4. The memory address on the heap stores the value assigned (**the empty `array []`**).

![example 4](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*CPnnVIgE0tQVbxIja_C-_A.jpeg)
![example 5](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*0x_h4Q0eu-rpA0YxHJBJdg.jpeg)

From here, we could `push`, `pop`, or do whatever we wanted to to our `array`.

```js
myArray.push("first");
myArray.push("second");
myArray.push("third");
myArray.push("fourth");
myArray.pop();
```

![example 6](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*XfqW2Xh5oJrChzhRAauf9Q.jpeg)

#### More Examples

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 24,
};

// -> JS allocates memory for this object in the heap.
// -> The actual values are still primitive, which is why they are stored in the stack.
```

Note above how person and newPerson both point to the same object.

## Garbage Collection

---

The last step is releasing memory and this is where `garbage collection` comes into play (**which is also handled by the `JavaScript Engine`**).

> **Algorithms** are used to pinpoint unneeded memory that needs to be released. The **mark-and-sweep algorithm** has been implemented in all modern browsers since 2012.

### Mark-and-sweep algorithm

- The mark-and-sweep algorithm has a solution to cyclic dependencies. Instead of simply counting the `references` to a given `object`, it detects if they are **reachable from the root object**.
- The `root` in the browser is the `window` object, while in NodeJS this is `global`.
- The algorithm **marks the `objects` that aren't reachable** as garbage, and **sweeps (collects) them afterward**. `Root objects` will never be collected.

### Trade-offs

Automatic `garbage collection` allows us to focus on building applications instead of losing time with memory management. However, there are some tradeoffs that we need to be aware of.

- **Memory usage**
  - Given that the algorithms can't know when exactly memory won't be needed anymore, **JavaScript applications may use more memory than they actually need**.
  - Even though `objects` are marked as garbage, it's up to the `garbage collector` to decide when and if the allocated memory will be collected.
  - If you need your application to be as memory efficient as possible, you're better off with a lower-level language. But keep in mind that this comes with its own set of trade-offs.
- **Performance**
  - The algorithms that collect garbage for us usually run periodically to clean unused `objects`.
  - The issue with this is that we, the developers, don't know when exactly this will happen. Collecting a lot of garbage or collecting garbage frequently might impact performance since it needs a certain amount of computation power to do so.

## Memory leaks

---

Here are the most common memory leaks:

- **Global variables**
  - Storing data in `global variables` is probably the most common type of memory leak.
  - Avoid this by running your code in **strict mode**.
  - You can certainly make use of `global variables`, but make sure you free space up once you don't need the data anymore.
  - To release memory, assign the `global variable` to `null`.
    > **Note**: ES6 modules are JavaScript files that executes in **strict mode only**. It means that any variables or functions declared in the module won’t be added automatically to the global scope.
- **Forgotten timers and callbacks**
  - Forgetting about `timers` and `callbacks` can make the memory usage of your application go up. Especially in Single Page Applications (`SPAs`), you have to be careful when adding `event listeners` and `callbacks` dynamically.
  - **Make sure to clear and remove any `listeners` or `timers`**.
