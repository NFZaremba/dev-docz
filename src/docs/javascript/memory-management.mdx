# Memory Management

<br />

## Memory Life Cycle

---

- In `JavaScript`, memory life cycle is composed of 3 steps:

  1. _Memory Allocation_ - When you assign a variable or create a function or object some amount of memory has to be allocated for it.
  2. _Memory Use_ - Reading from variables or changing values is reading from, and write to, memory.
  3. _Memory Release_ - When you no longer use some function or object, that memory is released via _Garbage Collection_.

## Memory Heap and Call Stack

---

- `JavaScript engines` have two places where they can store data: The `memory heap` and `stack` located in the `RAM`.

### `Stack` - _static memory allocation_

> - The `stack` is where static data is stored, including `primitive` data types and `references` (_these references point to objects and functions you've created_)
> - The static data have fixed sizes and so the `JavaScript engine` knows how much memory to allocate before execution.
> - Allocating memory during compile time is known as _static memory allocation_.

### `Heap` - _dynamic memory allocation_

> - The `heap` is where `objects` (`objects`, `functions`, `arrays`, `classes`) are stored.
> - Unlike the stack, the engine doesn't allocate a fixed amount of memory for these objects. Instead, more space will be allocated as needed.
> - Allocating memory during runtime is known as _dynamic memory allocation_.

| _Stack_                            | _Heap_                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Primitive values and references    | Objects and functions     |
| Size is known at compile time      | Size is known at run time |
| Allocates a fixed amount of memory | No limit per object       |

## Memory Allocation

---

- Non-primitive data types behave differently compared to primitive data types.

### `Primitives`

> **Simple Example**
>
> > - Let’s start off with a simple example. Below, we declare a variable called `myNumber` and initialize it with a value of `23`.
> >
> >   ```js
> >   let myNumber = 23;
> >   ```
> >
> > - When this code executes, `JavaScript Engine` will...
> >
> >   1.  Create a unique identifier for your variable `myNumber`.
> >   2.  Allocate an address in memory (_will be assigned at runtime_).
> >   3.  Store a value at the address allocated `23`.
> >
> >   ![example 1](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*IiejRUFbks-TaOzJJvdoVw.jpeg)
> >
> >   4.  While we would colloquially say, _“myNumber equals 23”_, more technically, `myNumber` equals the memory address that holds the value `23`. This >is a crucial distinction to understand.
> >
> > <br />
> >
> > - If we were to create a new variable called `newVar` and assign it `myNumber` …
> >
> >   ```js
> >   let newVar = myNumber;
> >   ```
> >
> >   - … since `myNumber` technically equals _“0012CCGWH80”_, `newVar` would also equal _“0012CCGWH80”_, which is the memory address that holds the value `23`. Ultimately, this has the intended effect of colloquially saying, _“newVar is now equal to 23.”_

> > <br />
>
> **Here’s another example:**
>
> Take a look at the code below...
>
> ```js
> let myString = "abc";
> myString = myString + "d";
> ```
>
> While a novice JS programmer may say that the letter `d` is simply appended to the string `abc` wherever it exists in memory, this is technically false. When `abc` is concatenated with `d`, since `strings` are also `primitive data types` in JS, a new memory address is allocated, `abcd` is stored there, and `myString` points to this new memory address.

> #### More Examples:
>
> ```js
> let name = "John"; // allocates memory for a string
> const age = 24; // allocates memory for a number
>
> name = "John Doe"; // allocates memory for a new string
> const firstName = name.slice(0, 4); // allocates memory for a new string
>
> // -> Primitive values are immutable, which means that instead of changing the original value, JavaScript creates a new one.
> ```

### `References`

> All `variables` first point to the `stack`. In case it's a non-primitive value, the `stack` contains a `reference` to the `object` in the `heap`.
>
> The memory of the `heap` is not ordered in any particular way, which is why we need to keep a `reference` to it in the stack. _You can think of references as addresses and the objects in the `heap` as houses that these addresses belong to_.
>
> > Remember that JavaScript stores objects and functions in the `heap`. `Primitive values` and `references` are stored in the `stack`.
>
> <br />
>
> Let's start with an example...
>
> ```js
> let myArray = [];
> ```
>
> This is what happens in memory:
>
> 1.  Create a unique identifier for your variable `myArray`.
> 2.  Allocate an address in memory (_will be assigned at runtime_).
> 3.  Store a value of a memory address allocated on the heap (_will be assigned at runtime_).
> 4.  The memory address on the heap stores the value assigned (_the empty `array []`_).
>

>
> ![example 5](https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*0x_h4Q0eu-rpA0YxHJBJdg.jpeg)
>
> From here, we could `push`, `pop`, or do whatever we wanted to to our `array`.
>
> ```js
> myArray.push("first");
> myArray.push("second");
> myArray.push("third");
> myArray.push("fourth");
> myArray.pop();
> ```
>

> <br />
>
> #### More Examples:
>
> ```js
> const person = {
>   name: "John",
>   age: 24,
> };
>
> // -> JS allocates memory for this object in the heap.
> // -> The actual values are still primitive, which is why they are stored in the stack.

> Note above how `person` and `newPerson` both point to the same object.

## Garbage Collection

---

- The last step is releasing memory and this is where `garbage collection` comes into play (which is also handled by the `JavaScript Engine`).

- _Algorithms_ are used to pinpoint unneeded memory that needs to be released. The _mark-and-sweep algorithm_ has been implemented in all modern browsers since 2012.

### `Mark-and-sweep algorithm`

> - The mark-and-sweep algorithm has a solution to cyclic dependencies. Instead of simply counting the `references` to a given `object`, it detects if they are _reachable from the root object_.
> - The `root` in the browser is the `window` object, while in NodeJS this is `global`.
> - The algorithm _marks the `objects` that aren't reachable_ as garbage, and _sweeps (collects) them afterward_. `Root objects` will never be collected.

### `Trade-offs`

> Automatic `garbage collection` allows us to focus on building applications instead of losing time with memory management. However, there are some tradeoffs that we need to be aware of.
>
> - `Memory usage`
>   - Given that the algorithms can't know when exactly memory won't be needed anymore, _JavaScript applications may use more memory than they actually need_.
>   - Even though `objects` are marked as garbage, it's up to the `garbage collector` to decide when and if the allocated memory will be collected.
>   - If you need your application to be as memory efficient as possible, you're better off with a lower-level language. But keep in mind that this comes with its own set of trade-offs.
> - `Performance`
>   - The algorithms that collect garbage for us usually run periodically to clean unused `objects`.
>   - The issue with this is that we, the developers, don't know when exactly this will happen. Collecting a lot of garbage or collecting garbage frequently might impact performance since it needs a certain amount of computation power to do so.

## Memory leaks

---

Here are the most common memory leaks:

### `Global variables`

> - Storing data in `global variables` is probably the most common type of memory leak.
> - Avoid this by running your code in _strict mode_.
> - You can certainly make use of `global variables`, but make sure you free space up once you don't need the data anymore.
> - To release memory, assign the `global variable` to `null`.
>   > _Note_: ES6 modules are JavaScript files that executes in _strict mode only_. It means that any variables or functions declared in the module won’t be added automatically to the global scope.

#### `Forgotten timers and callbacks`

> - Forgetting about `timers` and `callbacks` can make the memory usage of your application go up. Especially in Single Page Applications (`SPAs`), you have to be careful when adding `event listeners` and `callbacks` dynamically.
> - _Make sure to clear and remove any `listeners` or `timers`_.
