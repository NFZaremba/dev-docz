# How JavaScript Works

<br />

## JavaScript Engine vs Runtime Environment

---

- In web development, each browser has a `JavaScript Runtime Environment`, and in that runtime is a `JavaScript engine` that parses the code.

- `AJAX`, the `DOM tree`, and other `API’s`, are not part of `JavaScript`, they are just objects with properties and methods, provided by the browser and made available in the browser’s `JS Runtime Environment`.

## JavaScript Engine

---

- A `JavaScript engine` is a program or an `interpreter` which _parses and executes JavaScript code_.

- It can be implemented as a standard `interpreter`, or `just-in-time compiler` that compiles `JavaScript` to `bytecode` in some form.

- When running a `JavaScript` program, two regions of memory are allocated on the machine's `RAM` (Random Access Memory), to store things like the `runtime`, `variables` and `objects` that you reference in your code. The `Heap` and `Stack`.

## Runtime Environment

---

- Provides additional _scripts/features/API's_ at runtime to build JavaScript based software.

  - `Browser` - DOM API, Fetch API, Timer (setTimeout/setInterval), Storage (local storage), etc.
  - `Server Environment` - File System, Network, Console, etc

- Think of the `JavaScript runtime environment` as a big container. Within the big container are other smaller containers. As the `JavaScript engine` parses the code it starts putting pieces of it into different containers.

### `Memory Heap`

> - Unstructured memory pool where we can store complex objects.
> - Is `Garbage Collected`.

### `Call Stack`

> - LIFO principle - last-in-first-out.
> - Helps keep track of where we are in the code so that we can run the code in order.
> - The call stack is designed to be a high performance continuous region of memory used to execute functions.
> - When you call a function, it creates a frame in the stack that contains a copy of its local variables.

### `Web API Container`

> - Calls that were sent to the `Web API` container from the `Stack`, like event listeners, HTTP/AJAX requests, or timing functions, sit there until an action is triggered.
> - Once triggered, a 'callback function' is sent to the final container, the `callback queue`.

### `Callback Queue`

> - The `Queue` is a FIFO (first in first out) data structure.
> - The `Callback Queue` will store all the callback functions in the order in which they were added. It will 'wait' until the `Stack` is completely empty.

### `Event Loop`

> - The `Event Loop` is implemented in runtime environment.
> - Its job is to constantly look at the `Stack` and the `Queue`. If the `Stack` is empty, it will notify the `Queue` to send over its next callback function.

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking I/O

---

- Blocking is when the execution of additional `JavaScript` in the `Node.js` process must wait until a non-JavaScript operation completes. This happens because the `event loop` is unable to continue running `JavaScript` while a blocking operation is occurring.
