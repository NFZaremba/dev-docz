# Control Flow & Coercion

<br />

## What is Type Coercion

---

To understand control flow of `JavaScript`, type `coercion` must be understood.

Type `Coercion` is the conversion of a value from **one type to another**. It can occur both when you intentionally (**explicit**) want to convert the type, and when the `JavaScript engine` does it for you (**implicit**)

### Explicit Coercion

`Explicit coercion` is when you type cast a value from one type to another through the use of functions like `Number()` and `String()`.

```js
String(42); // ->  "42"
String(undefined); // -> "undefined"

Number("12"); // -> 12
Number("abc"); // -> NaN
Number(undefined); // -> NaN

Boolean(0); // -> false
Boolean(1); // -> true
Boolean(10); // -> true
```

### Implicit Coercion

Implicit Coercion is when the JavaScript does the type conversion in an expression for you behind the scenes. Implicit coercion will mostly take place in an expression with operands of different types.

## Operators

---

In JavaScript you have the following main operators:

- assignment operators ( =, +=, -=, etc)
- comparison operators (==, ===, !=, etc)
- arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, etc)
- logical operators ( &&, ||, !, etc)

### Assignment operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

```js
let x = 10; // -> The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
x += 5; // -> The += assignment operator adds a value to a variable.
x -= 5; // -> The -= assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.
x *= 5; // -> The *= assignment operator multiplies a variable.
```
